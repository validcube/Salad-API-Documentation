Hello and welcome to the unofficial Salad API Documentation!

Most of you are probably asking, "Is this allowed and why create this?" Well, yes, it is allowed. We are doing this because Salad did not provide us, the developers (or, more accurately, the nerds), with any documentation on how their API works.

This repository was meant to 
* ‚è© Accelerate the creation of 3rd-party applications that use Salad API! This would certainly bring interesting competition and not to mention showcase their work on the Salad Discord!
* üå± Introduce people into the world of programming!
